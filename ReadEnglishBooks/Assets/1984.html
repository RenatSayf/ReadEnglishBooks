                The gin was poured for them into big cups and they walked
                through the crowded canteen to a metal table. There were some
                pieces of meat on the table from the last person's meal.
            </p>
            <p>
                They ate in silence. Winston drank down his gin, which
                brought tears to his eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                'How's the Dictionary?' he said, speaking loudly because of
                the noise.
            </p>
            <p>
                ' I'm on the adjectives,' said Syme. 'It's wonderful work. 'His
                eyes shone. He pushed his plate away, took his bread in one pale
                hand and his cheese in the other, and put his mouth near
                Winston's ear so he did not have to shout. 'The eleventh edition
                is the final one,' he said. 'We're building a new language. When
                we've finished, people like you will have to learn to speak again.
                You think the main job is inventing new words, don't you?
                Wrong! We're destroying words — lots of them, hundreds of
                them, every day. We're only leaving the really necessary ones, and
                they'll stay in use for a long time.'
            </p>
            <p>
                He ate his bread hungrily. His thin, dark face had come alive
                and his eyes were shining like the eyes of a man in love. 'It's a
                beautiful thing to destroy words,' he said. 'For example, a word
                like "good". If you have "good" in the language, you don't need
                "bad".You can say "ungood".'
            </p>
            <p>
                Winston smiled. It was safer not to say anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                Syme continued. 'Do you understand? The aim of Newspeak
                is to narrow thought. In the end we will make <i>thoughtcrime</i>
                impossible, because people won't have the words to think the
                crime. By the year 2050 there will be nobody alive who could
                even understand this conversation.'
            </p>
            <p>
                'Except . . .' Winston began and then stopped. He wanted to
                say, 'Except the <i>proles'</i> But he was not sure if the Party would
                accept the thought.
            </p>
            <p>
                Syme had guessed what he was going to say. 'The <i>proles</i>proles are not
                really people,' he said. 'By 2050 - earlier, probably - you won't<span style="color:transparent;">.</span>
