                seemed to laugh at you and to search your face closely when he
                talked to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                'Have you got any razor blades?' asked Syme.
            </p>
            <p>
                'None,' said Winston quickly, perhaps too quickly. 'I've looked
                for them everywhere.' Everyone was asking for razor blades.
                There had been none in the Party shops for months. There was
                always something which the Party could not make enough of.
                Sometimes it was buttons, sometimes it was wool; now it was
                razor blades. 'I've been using the same blade for six weeks,' he
                lied. He actually had two new ones at home.
            </p>
            <p>
                The people waiting for food and gin moved forward, slowly.
                Winston and Syme took dirty plates from the pile.
            </p>
            <p>
                'Did you go to the park yesterday?' asked Syme. 'All the
                Eurasian prisoners were hanged.'              
            </p>
            <p>
                'I was working,' said Winston. 'I'll see it at the cinema.'
            </p>
            <p>
                'That's not as good,' said Syme. His eyes looked hard at
                Winston's face. 'I know you,' they seemed to say. 'I know why you
                didn't go to see the prisoners die.'
            </p>
            <p>
                Syme was an enthusiastic supporter of the Party's decisions
                about war, prisoners, thoughtcrime, the deaths in the underground
                rooms below the Ministry of Love. Winston always tried to move
                conversation with him away from all that. Syme knew a lot about
                Newspeak and when he talked about language he was interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
                'The prisoners kicked when they were hanged,' said Syme. 'I
                always like that. It spoils it when their legs are tied together. And
                one of them had his tongue hanging right out of his mouth. It
                was quite a bright blue. I like that kind of detail.'
            </p>
            <p>
                'Next, please,' called the prole who was giving out the food,
                and Winston and Syme gave her their plates. She put some grey
                meat on each one. There was also some bread, a small piece of
                cheese and a cup of sugarless black coffee.
            </p>
            <p>
                'There's a table there, under that telescreen,' said Syme. 'Let's get
                a gin and sit there.'
