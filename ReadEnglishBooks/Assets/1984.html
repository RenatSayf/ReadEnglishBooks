                17 March, he had said that South India was safe. The Eurasians
                would attack North Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
                This had not happened. The Eurasians had attacked South
                India, not North Africa. Winston had to re-write part of Big
                Brother's speech so you could read in the <i>Times</i> for 17 March
                that Big Brother had known about the attack before it happened.

                When Winston had finished, his changes to the <i>Times</i> went
                with the newspaper down the middle hole. A new edition would
                soon appear, with his changes. Every copy of the old edition
                would disappear. Destroyed. The message to Winston with the
                changes would disappear down the memory hole, to be burned.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every day newspapers, magazines, photographs, films, posters
                and books were all changed. The past was changed. The Party was
                always right. The Party had always been right. The Records
                Department, where they destroyed all the old copies of
                everything, was the largest department in the Ministry of Truth,
                but there was no truth. The new copies were not true and the old
                copies had not been true either.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the Ministry of Plenty had said they would make
                145 million pairs of boots last year. Sixty-two million pairs were
                made. Winston changed 145 million to 57 million. So the Party
                had made five million more boots last year than they expected to.
                But it was possible that no boots at all were made last year. And it
                was possible that nobody knew or cared how many boots were
                made. You could read in the newspapers that five million extra
                pairs of boots had been made and you could see that half the
                people in Oceania had no boots.
            </p>
            <p>
                Winston looked around the office. A woman with fair hair
                spent all day looking for the names of people who had been
                <i>vaporized</i>. Each of them was, in Newspeak, an <i>unperson</i>. She took
                their names out of every newspaper, book, letter... Her own
                husband had been <i>vaporized</i> last year. She took his name out too.
