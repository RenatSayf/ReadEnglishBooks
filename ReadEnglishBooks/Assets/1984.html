                letters next to Winston's name in a little notebook. It was clear
                that he rarely read or wrote.
            </p>
            <p>
                'Oh, Smith, old boy,' he said. 'I hear that son of mine threw
                stones at you yesterday. I talked to him about it. He won't do it
                again, believe me.'
            </p>
            <p>
                'I think he was angry because he couldn't see the Eurasian
                prisoners hang,' said Winston.
            </p>
            <p>
                'Yes! Well, that shows what good children they are, doesn't it?
                Both of them. They only think about the Spies — and the war, of
                course. Do you know what my girl did last week? She was on a
                walk in the country with the Spies and she saw a strange man.
                She and two other girls followed him and then told the police
                about him.'
            </p>
            <p>
                'What did they do that for?'Winston asked, shocked.
            </p>
            <p>
                'They thought he was a Eurasian spy,' said Parsons. 'They
                noticed his shoes were different,' he added proudly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Winston looked at the dirty canteen, looked at all the ugly
                people in their ugly overalls, ate the terrible food and listened to
                the telescreen. A voice from the Ministry of Plenty was saying that
                they were all going to get more chocolate — twenty grammes a
                week. Was he the only one who remembered that last week they
                got thirty grammes? They were getting less chocolate, not more.
                But Parsons would not remember. And even a clever man like
                Syme found a way to believe it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Winston came out of his sad dream. The girl with dark hair, who
                he remembered from the Two Minutes Hate, was at the next table.
                She was looking at him, but when he looked back at her she looked
                away again. Winston was suddenly afraid. Why was she watching
                him? Was she following him? Perhaps she was not in the Thought
                Police, but Party members could be even more dangerous as spies.
                How had he looked when the <i>telescreen</i> voice told them about the
                chocolate? It was dangerous to look disbelieving. There was even a
                word for it in Newspeak: <i>facecrime</i>, it was called.
