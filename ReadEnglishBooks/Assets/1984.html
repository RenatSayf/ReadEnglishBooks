                moved well. She had an interesting face, until you found out that
                there was almost nothing behind it. She believed everything the
                Party said. She had sex only because it was her duty to try and
                have children. When no children came, they agreed to separate.

                Every two or three years since then, Winston had found a prole
                woman who had agreed to have sex for money. But he wanted
                his own woman. He finished the story in his diary:
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>
                    When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman. She had no
                    teeth at all. But I had sex with her.
                </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                He had written it down at last, but it did not help. He still
                wanted to shout and scream.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center">&bull;</p>
            <p>
                He had walked several kilometres. It was the second time in three
                weeks that he had missed an evening at the Party Members'
                Club. This was not a good idea; your attendance at the Club was
                carefully checked. A Party member had no free time and was
                never alone except in bed. It was dangerous to do anything alone,
                even go for a walk. There was a word for it in Newspeak: <i>ownlife</i>,
                it was called, meaning separation from everybody else.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was walking in a prole area near a building that had, in the
                past, been an important railway station. The houses were small
                and dirty and reminded him of rat-holes. There were hundreds of
                people in the streets: pretty young girls, young men chasing the
                girls, fat old women - the pretty girls in ten years time. Dirty
                children with no shoes ran through the mud.

                The people looked at him strangely. The blue overalls of the
                Party were an unusual sight in a street like this. It was unwise to
                be seen in such places, unless you had a definite reason to be
                there. The Thought Police would stop you if they saw you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suddenly everybody was shouting and screaming and running
                back into their rat-hole houses. A man in a black suit ran past
                Winston and pointed at the sky.
