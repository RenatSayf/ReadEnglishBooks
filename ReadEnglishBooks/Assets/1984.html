                The girl had turned her back to him again. At that moment
                the telescreen told them all to return to work and the three men
                jumped to their feet.

                Winston sat at the table and opened his diary. He thought of his
                parents. He was, he thought, about ten or eleven years old when
                his mother disappeared. She was a tall, silent woman with lovely
                fair hair. He could not remember his father so well. He was dark
                and thin and always wore dark clothes. They had both been
                vaporized in the 1950s. His thoughts moved to other women and
                he started writing in the diary:

                    It was three years ago. It was on a dark evening, in a narrow sidestreet
                    near one of the big railway stations. She had a young face with
                    thick make-up. I liked the make-up. The whiteness and the bright red
                    lips. No woman in the Party wore make-up. There was nobody else in the
                    street and no telescreens. She said two dollars. I...

                It was too difficult to continue. Winston wanted to hit his head
                against the wall, to kick the table over and throw the diary through
                the window - anything to stop the memory of that night.

                It was, of course, illegal to pay a woman for sex. But the
                punishment was about five years in a work camp, not death. The
                Party knew it happened. Some prole women sold themselves for a
                bottle of gin and the Party didn't worry much about that. The Party
                wanted to stop love and pleasure in sex, not sex itself. A request to
                marry would be refused if a man and a woman found each other
                attractive. Sex, to the Party, was only necessary to make children.

                He thought of Katherine, his wife. Winston had been married.
                He was probably still married; if his wife was dead, nobody had
                told him. They had lived together for about fifteen months, nine,
                ten, eleven years ago. Katherine was a tall, fair-haired girl who
