                need a slogan like "freedom is slavery". The word "freedom"
                won't exist, so the whole idea of freedom won't exist either.
                The good Party member won't have ideas. If you're a good Party
                member, you won't need to think.'

                One of these days, thought Winston, Syme will be vaporized.
                He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too openly.
                He goes to the Chestnut Tree Cafe, where the painters and
                musicians go and where Goldstein himself used to go. The Party
                does not like people like that. One day he will disappear. It is
                written in his face.
            </p>
            <p>
                Syme looked up. 'Here comes Parsons,' he said. You could hear
                his opinion of Parsons in his voice. He thought Parsons was a fool.
            </p>
            <p>
                Winston's neighbour from Victory Mansions was coming
                towards them. He was a fat, middle-sized man with fair hair and
                an ugly face. He looked like a little boy in a man's clothes.
                Winston imagined h im wearing not his blue Party overalls but
                the uniform of the Spies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Parsons shouted 'Hello, hello' happily and sat down at the
                table. He smelled of sweat. Syme took a piece of paper from his
                pocket with a list of words on it and studied the words with an
                ink-pencil between his fingers.
            </p>
            <p>
                'Look at him, working in the lunch hour!' said Parsons. 'What
                have you got there, old boy? Something a bit too clever for me, I
                expect. Smith, old boy, I'll tell you why I 'm chasing you. It's the
                money you forgot to give me.'
            </p>
            <p>
                'What money?' said Winston, feeling for money in his pocket.
                About a quarter of your earnings were paid back to the Party in
                different ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                'The money for Hate Week. You know I collect the money for
                Victory Mansions, and we're going to have the best flags around.
                Two dollars you promised me.'
            </p>
            <p>
                Winston found two dirty dollar notes and gave them to
                Parsons. Parsons wrote 'Two dollars' very carefully in small clear.
