        <h3>Chapter 1. Brother Is Watching You.</h3>

        <p>
            It was a bright, cold day in April and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith hurried home to Victory Mansions with his head down to escape the terrible wind. A cloud of dust blew inside with him, and the hall smelled of dust and yesterday's food.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the end of the hall, a poster covered one wall. It showed an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a handsome man of about forty-five, with a large, black moustache. The man's eyes seemed to follow Winston as he moved. Below the face were the words <b>BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU.</b>
		</p>

        <p>
            Winston went up the stairs. He did not even try the lift. It rarely worked and at the moment the electricity was switched off during the day to save money for Hate Week. The flat was on the seventh floor and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a bad knee, went slowly, resting several times on the way. Winston as a small man and looked even smaller in the blue overalls of the Party. His hair was fair and the skin on his face, which used to be pink, was red and rough from cheap soap, old razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.
        </p>

        <p>
            Inside his flat, a voice was reading out a list of figures for last year's production of iron. The voice came from a metal square, a <i>telescreen</i>, in the right-hand wall. Winston turned it down, but there was no way of turning it off completely.
        </p>

        <p>
            He moved to the window. Outside, the world looked cold. The wind blew dust and bits of paper around in the street and there seemed to be no colour in anything, except in the posters that were everywhere. The face with the black moustache looked down from every corner. There was one on the house opposite. <b>BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU</b>, it said, and the eyes looked into Winston's.
        </p>		
		</div>|





        <div class="book-page">
		<p>
            Behind him the voice from the telescreen was still talking about
            iron. There was now even more iron in Oceania than the Ninth
            Three-Year Plan had demanded. The telescreen had a microphone,
            so the Thought Police could listen to Winston at any time of the
            day or night. They could also watch him through the telescreen.
            Nobody knew how often they actually did that but everybody
            behaved correctly all the time because the Thought Police might
            be watching and listening.
        </p>

        <p>
            Winston kept his back to the telescreen. It was safer that way -
            they couldn't see your face. He looked out over London, the
            biggest city in this part of Oceania. The nineteenth-century
            houses were all falling down. There were holes in the streets
            where the bombs had fallen. Had it always been like this? He
            tried to think back to the time when he was a boy, but he could
            remember nothing.
        </p>

        <p>
            He stared at the Ministry of Truth, where he worked. It was an
            enormous white building, three hundred metres high. You could
            see the white roof, high above the houses, even a kilometre away.
            From Winston's flat it was just possible to see the three slogans of
            the Party written in enormous letters on the side of the building:
        </p>

        <h3>WAR IS PEACE</h3>
        <h3>FREEDOM IS SLAVERY</h3>
        <h3>IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</h3>

        <p>
            The Ministry of Truth was called Minitrue in Newspeak, the
            new language of Oceania. Minitrue, it was said, had more than
            three thousand rooms above the ground and a similar number
            below. The people there worked mainly on news and
            entertainment. High above the surrounding buildings, Winston
            could also see the Ministry of Peace, where they worked on war.
            It was called Minipax in Newspeak. And the Ministry of Plenty —
            Miniplenty — which was responsible for the economy. And he
            could see the Ministry of Love — Miniluv — which was responsible
            for law and order.
        </p>
		</div>|




        <div class="book-page">
		<p>
            The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There
            were no windows in it. Nobody could get anywhere near it
            unless they had business there. There were guards with guns in
            black uniforms even in the streets half a kilometre away.
        </p>

        <p>
            Winston turned round quickly. He smiled. It was a good idea
            to look happy when you were facing the telescreen. He went to his
            small kitchen. He had not had lunch in the canteen before he left
            work, but there was no food there except a piece of dark, hard
            bread for tomorrow's breakfast. He poured himself a cup of
            colourless, oily gin and drank it down like medicine. It burned
            him inside, but he felt more cheerful afterwards.
        </p>

        <p>
            He went back to the living room and sat down at a small table
            to the left of the telescreen. It was the only place in the room
            where the telescreen could not see him. From a drawer in the table
            he took out a pen and a big diary with beautiful cream paper,
            which he had bought in an old-fashioned shop in a poor part of
            the town. Party members like Winston were not allowed to go
            into ordinary shops, but many of them did. It was the only way to
            get things like razor blades.
        </p>

        <p>
            Winston opened the diary. This was not illegal. Nothing was
            illegal, as there were no laws now. But if the diary was found they
            would punish him with death or with twenty-five years in a
            prison camp. He took the pen in his hand, then stopped. He felt
            sick. It was a decisive act to start writing.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center">&bull;</p>

        <p>
            Earlier that morning, a terrible noise from the big telescreen at the
            Ministry of Truth had called all the workers to the centre of the
            hall for the Two Minutes Hate. The face of Emmanuel Goldstein,
            Enemy of the People, filled the telescreen. It was a thin, clever face,
            with its white hair and small beard, but there was something
            unpleasant about it. Goldstein began to speak in his sheep-like
            voice: criticising the Party, making nasty attacks on Big Brother,
            demanding peace with Eurasia.
        </p>
		</div>|




        <div class="book-page">
		<p>
            In the past (nobody knew exactly when) Goldstein had been
            almost as important in the Party as Big Brother himself, but then
            he had worked against the Party. Before he could be punished
            with death, he had escaped — nobody knew how, exactly.
            Somewhere he was still alive, and all crimes against the Party
            came from his teaching.
        </p>

        <p>
            Behind Goldstein's face on the telescreen were thousands of
            Eurasian soldiers. Oceania was always at war with either Eurasia
            or Eastasia. That changed, but the hate for Goldstein never did.
            The Thought Police found his spies every day. They were called
            'the Brotherhood', people said, although Winston sometimes
            asked himself if the Brotherhood really existed. Goldstein had
            also written a book, a terrible book, a book against the Party. It
            had no title; it was just known as the book.
        </p>

        <p>
            As Goldstein's face filled the telescreen and Eurasian soldiers
            marched behind him, the Hate grew. People jumped up and
            down, shouting and screaming so they could not hear Goldstein's
            voice. Winston was shouting too; it was impossible not to. A girl
            behind him, with thick, dark hair was screaming 'Pig! Pig!' at
            Goldstein, and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak
            dictionary and threw it at the telescreen. It hit Goldstein on the
            nose and fell to the floor.
        </p>

        <p>
            Winston had often seen this girl at the Ministry but he had
            never spoken to her. He did not know her name, but he knew
            she worked in the Fiction Department. He had seen her with
            tools so he guessed she was a mechanic on the story-writing
            machines. She was a confident-looking girl of about twentyseven,
            and she walked quickly. She wore the narrow red belt of
            the Young People's League tied tightly round her overalls.
        </p>

        <p>
            Winston had disliked her from the first moment he saw her.
            He disliked nearly all women, especially young and pretty ones.
            The young women were always most loyal to the Party and were
            happiest to spy on others. But this girl was especially dangerous,

            he thought. Once, when he had seen her in the canteen, she had
            looked at h im in a way that filled h im w i th black terror. He even
            thought she might be working for the Thought Police. As the
            screaming at Goldstein increased, Winston's dislike of the girl
            turned to hate. He hated her because she was young and pretty.
        </p>

        <p>
            Suddenly he noticed someone else, sitting near the girl,
            wearing the black overalls of an Inner Party member. O'Brien
            was a large man with a thick neck and glasses. Although he
            looked frightening, Winston was interested in him. There was
            sometimes an intelligence in his face that suggested - perhaps -
            that he might question the official Party beliefs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Winston had seen O'Brien about twelve times in almost as
            many years. Years ago he had dreamed about O'Brien. He was in
            a dark room and O'Brien had said to him, We shall meet in the
            place where there is no dark. 'Winston did not know what that
            meant, but he was sure it would happen, one day.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Hate increased. The screaming increased. The voice and
            face of Goldstein became the voice and face of a real sheep. Then
            the sheep-face became a Eurasian soldier, walking towards them
            with his gun, so close that some people shut their eyes for a
            second and moved back in their seats. But at the same moment
            the soldier became the face of Big Brother, black-haired,
            moustached, filling the telescreen. Nobody could hear what Big
            Brother said, but it was enough that he was speaking to them.
            Then the face of Big Brother disappeared from the telescreen and
            the Party slogans came up instead:
        </p>

        <h4>WAR IS PEACE</h4>
        <h4>FREEDOM IS SLAVERY</h4>
        <h4>IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</h4>

        <p>
            Then everybody started shouting 'B-B! B-B!' again and again,
            slowly, with a long pause between the first B and the second. Of
            course Winston shouted too - you had to. But there was a second
        </p>
		</div>|





        <div class="book-page">
		<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
            when the look on his face showed what he was thinking. And at
            that exact moment his eyes met O'Brien's.
        </p>

        <p>O'Brien was pushing his glasses up his nose. But Winston
knew - yes he knew - that O'Brien was thinking the same thing
as he was. 'I am w i th you,' O'Brien seemed to say to him. 'I hate
all this too.' And then the moment of intelligence was gone and
O'Brien's face looked like everybody else's.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center">&bull;</p>

        <p>Winston wrote the date in his diary: April 4th 1984. Then he
stopped. He did not know definitely that this was 1984. He was
thirty-nine, he believed - he had been born in 1944 or 1945. But
nobody could be sure of dates, not really.</p>

        <p>Who am I writing this diary for?' he asked himself suddenly.
For the future, for the unborn. But if the future was like the
present, it would not listen to him. And if it was different, his
situation would be meaningless.</p>

        <p>The telescreen was playing marching music. What had he
intended to say? Winston stared at the page, then began to write:
Freedom is the freedom to say that two and two make four. If you have
that, everything else follows . . . He stopped. Should he go on? If he
wrote more or did not write more, the result would be the same.
The Thought Police would get him. Even before he wrote
anything, his crime was clear. Thoughtcrime, they called it.</p>

        <p>It was always at night - the rough hand on your shoulder, the
lights in your face. People just disappeared, always during the
night. And then your name disappeared, your existence was
denied and then forgotten. You were, in Newspeak, vaporized.</p>

        <p>Suddenly he wanted to scream. He started writing, fast:</p>
        <h5><i>DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER</i></h5>
        <h5><i>DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER</i></h5>
        <h5><i>DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER</i></h5>
		</div>

		<div class="book-page">
		<p>
            There was a knock on the door. Already! He sat as quietly as a
            mouse, hoping that they would go away. But no, there was
            another knock. He could not delay - that would be the worst
            thing he could do. His heart was racing but even now his face,
            from habit, probably showed nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            He got up and walked heavily towards the door.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Chapter 2 The Spies</h3>
        <p>
            As he opened the door, Winston saw that he had left the diary
            open on the table. DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER was written
            in it, in letters you could almost read across the room.
        </p>
        <p>
            But everything was all right. A small, sad-looking woman was
            standing outside.
        </p>
        <p>
            'Oh, Comrade Smith,' she said, in a dull little voice, 'do you
            think you could come across and help me with our kitchen sink?
            The water isn't running away and ...'
        </p>
        <p>
            It was Mrs Parsons, his neighbour. She was about thirty but
            looked much older. Winston followed her into her flat. These
            repairs happened almost daily. The Victory Mansions flats were
            old, built in about 1930, and they were falling to pieces. Unless
            you did the repairs yourself, the Party had to agree to them. It
            could take two years to get new glass in a window.
            'Tom isn't home,' Mrs Parsons explained.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Parsons' flat was bigger than Winston's and unattractive in
            a different way. Everything was broken. There were sports clothes
            and sports equipment all over the floor, and dirty dishes on the
            table. On the walls were the red flags of the Young People's
            League and the Spies and a full-sized poster of Big Brother. There
            was the usual smell of old food, but also the smell of old sweat. In
            another room someone was singing with the marching music
            that was still coming from the telescreen.
        </p>
		</div>|









		<div class="book-page">
        <p>
            'It's the children,' said Mrs Parsons, looking in fear at the door to
            the other room. 'They haven't been out today and of course . . .'
            She often stopped without finishing her sentences.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the kitchen, the sink was full of dirty green water.
            ' O f course if Tom was home ...' Mrs Parsons started.
            Tom Parsons worked w i t h Winston at the Ministry of Truth.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was a fat but active man who was unbelievably stupid and
            endlessly enthusiastic. He was a follower with no mind of his
            own - the type that the Party needed even more than they
            needed the Thought Police.
        </p>
        <p>
            At thirty-five Tom Parsons had only just been thrown out of
            the Young People's League, although he had wanted to stay.
            Before that he had continued in the Spies for a year beyond the
            official age. At the Ministry he had a job which needed no
            intelligence, but he worked for the Party every evening,
            organizing walks and other activities. The smell of his sweat filled
            every room he was in and stayed there after he had gone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Winston repaired the sink, taking out the unpleasant knot of
            hair that was stopping the water running away. He washed his
            hands and went back to the other room. 'Put your hands up!' shouted a voice.
        </p>
        <p>
            A big, handsome boy of nine was pointing a toy gun at him.
            His small sister, about two years younger, pointed a piece of
            wood. Both were dressed in the blue, grey and red uniforms of
            the Spies. Winston put his hands up. The look of hate on the
            boy's face made him feel that it was not quite a game.
        </p>
        <p>
            'You're a Eurasian spy!' screamed the boy. 'You're a
            thoughtcriminal! I'll shoot you, I'll vaporize you!'
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly they were both running round him, shouting 'Spy!
            Thoughtcriminal!' The little girl did everything seconds after her
            older brother did it. It was frightening, like the games of young,
            dangerous wild animals that will soon be man-eaters. Winston
            could see that the boy really wanted to hit or kick him, and was
        </p>

            nearly big enough to do so. He was glad that the gun in the boy's
            hand was only a toy.
        </p>
        <p>
            'They wanted to see the Eurasian prisoners hang. But I 'm too
            busy to take them and Tom's at . . .'
        </p>
        <p>
            'We want to see them hang!' shouted the boy, and then the girl
            started shouting it too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes against
            Oceania, were going to hang slowly in the park that evening.
            This happened every month or two and was a popular evening's
            entertainment. Children were often taken to see it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Winston said goodbye to Mrs Parsons and walked towards the
            door. He heard a loud noise as a bomb fell. About twenty or
            thirty of them were falling on London each week. Then he felt a
            terrible pain in the back of his neck. He turned and saw Mrs
            Parsons trying to take some sharp stones from her son's hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            'Goldstein!' screamed the boy.
        </p>
        <p>
            But Winston was most shocked by the look of helpless terror
            on Mrs Parsons' grey face.
