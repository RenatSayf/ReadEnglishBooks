        <h3>Chapter 1. Brother Is Watching You.</h3>

        <p>
            It was a bright, cold day in April and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith hurried home to Victory Mansions with his head down to escape the terrible wind. A cloud of dust blew inside with him, and the hall smelled of dust and yesterday's food.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the end of the hall, a poster covered one wall. It showed an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a handsome man of about forty-five, with a large, black moustache. The man's eyes seemed to follow Winston as he moved. Below the face were the words <b>BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU</b>.
		</p>

        <p>
            Winston went up the stairs. He did not even try the lift. It rarely worked and at the moment the electricity was switched off during the day to save money for Hate Week. The flat was on the seventh floor and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a bad knee, went slowly, resting several times on the way. Winston as a small man and looked even smaller in the blue overalls of the Party. His hair was fair and the skin on his face, which used to be pink, was red and rough from cheap soap, old razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.
        </p>

        <p>
            Inside his flat, a voice was reading out a list of figures for last year's production of iron. The voice came from a metal square, a <i>telescreen</i>, in the right-hand wall. Winston turned it down, but there was no way of turning it off completely.
        </p>

        <p>
            He moved to the window. Outside, the world looked cold. The wind blew dust and bits of paper around in the street and there seemed to be no colour in anything, except in the posters that were everywhere. The face with the black moustache looked down from every corner. There was one on the house opposite. <b>BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU</b>, it said, and the eyes looked into Winston's.
        </p>		
		</div>|





        <div class="book-page">
		<p>
            Behind him the voice from the telescreen was still talking about iron. There was now even more iron in Oceania than the Ninth Three-Year Plan had demanded. The telescreen had a microphone, so the Thought Police could listen to Winston at any time of the day or night. They could also watch him through the telescreen. Nobody knew how often they actually did that but everybody behaved correctly all the time because the Thought Police might be watching and listening.
		</p>

        <p>
            Winston kept his back to the telescreen. It was safer that way - they couldn't see your face. He looked out over London, the biggest city in this part of Oceania. The nineteenth-century houses were all falling down. There were holes in the streets where the bombs had fallen. Had it always been like this? He tried to think back to the time when he was a boy, but he could remember nothing.
		</p>

        <p>
            He stared at the Ministry of Truth, where he worked. It was an enormous white building, three hundred metres high. You could see the white roof, high above the houses, even a kilometre away. From Winston's flat it was just possible to see the three slogans of the Party written in enormous letters on the side of the building:
		</p>

        <h3>WAR IS PEACE.</h3>
        <h3>FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.</h3>
        <h3>IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.</h3>

        <p>
            The Ministry of Truth was called Minitrue in Newspeak, the new language of Oceania. Minitrue, it was said, had more than three thousand rooms above the ground and a similar number below. The people there worked mainly on news and entertainment. High above the surrounding buildings, Winston could also see the Ministry of Peace, where they worked on war. It was called Minipax in Newspeak. And the Ministry of Plenty — Miniplenty — which was responsible for the economy. And he could see the Ministry of Love — Miniluv — which was responsible for law and order.
		</p>
		</div>|




        <div class="book-page">
		<p>
            The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There
            were no windows in it. Nobody could get anywhere near it
            unless they had business there. There were guards with guns in
            black uniforms even in the streets half a kilometre away.
        </p>

        <p>
            Winston turned round quickly. He smiled. It was a good idea
            to look happy when you were facing the telescreen. He went to his
            small kitchen. He had not had lunch in the canteen before he left
            work, but there was no food there except a piece of dark, hard
            bread for tomorrow's breakfast. He poured himself a cup of
            colourless, oily gin and drank it down like medicine. It burned
            him inside, but he felt more cheerful afterwards.
        </p>

        <p>
            He went back to the living room and sat down at a small table
            to the left of the telescreen. It was the only place in the room
            where the telescreen could not see him. From a drawer in the table
            he took out a pen and a big diary with beautiful cream paper,
            which he had bought in an old-fashioned shop in a poor part of
            the town. Party members like Winston were not allowed to go
            into ordinary shops, but many of them did. It was the only way to
            get things like razor blades.
        </p>

        <p>
            Winston opened the diary. This was not illegal. Nothing was
            illegal, as there were no laws now. But if the diary was found they
            would punish him with death or with twenty-five years in a
            prison camp. He took the pen in his hand, then stopped. He felt
            sick. It was a decisive act to start writing.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center">&bull;</p>

        <p>
            Earlier that morning, a terrible noise from the big telescreen at the
            Ministry of Truth had called all the workers to the centre of the
            hall for the Two Minutes Hate. The face of Emmanuel Goldstein,
            Enemy of the People, filled the telescreen. It was a thin, clever face,
            with its white hair and small beard, but there was something
            unpleasant about it. Goldstein began to speak in his sheep-like
            voice: criticising the Party, making nasty attacks on Big Brother,
            demanding peace with Eurasia.
        </p>
		</div>|




        <div class="book-page">
		<p>
            In the past (nobody knew exactly when) Goldstein had been
            almost as important in the Party as Big Brother himself, but then
            he had worked against the Party. Before he could be punished
            with death, he had escaped — nobody knew how, exactly.
            Somewhere he was still alive, and all crimes against the Party
            came from his teaching.
        </p>

        <p>
            Behind Goldstein's face on the telescreen were thousands of
            Eurasian soldiers. Oceania was always at war with either Eurasia
            or Eastasia. That changed, but the hate for Goldstein never did.
            The Thought Police found his spies every day. They were called
            'the Brotherhood', people said, although Winston sometimes
            asked himself if the Brotherhood really existed. Goldstein had
            also written a book, a terrible book, a book against the Party. It
            had no title; it was just known as the book.
        </p>

        <p>
            As Goldstein's face filled the telescreen and Eurasian soldiers
            marched behind him, the Hate grew. People jumped up and
            down, shouting and screaming so they could not hear Goldstein's
            voice. Winston was shouting too; it was impossible not to. A girl
            behind him, with thick, dark hair was screaming 'Pig! Pig!' at
            Goldstein, and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak
            dictionary and threw it at the telescreen. It hit Goldstein on the
            nose and fell to the floor.
        </p>

        <p>
            Winston had often seen this girl at the Ministry but he had
            never spoken to her. He did not know her name, but he knew
            she worked in the Fiction Department. He had seen her with
            tools so he guessed she was a mechanic on the story-writing
            machines. She was a confident-looking girl of about twentyseven,
            and she walked quickly. She wore the narrow red belt of
            the Young People's League tied tightly round her overalls.
        </p>

        <p>
            Winston had disliked her from the first moment he saw her.
            He disliked nearly all women, especially young and pretty ones.
            The young women were always most loyal to the Party and were
            happiest to spy on others. But this girl was especially dangerous,
        </p>

            he thought. Once, when he had seen her in the canteen, she had
            looked at h im in a way that filled h im w i th black terror. He even
            thought she might be working for the Thought Police. As the
            screaming at Goldstein increased, Winston's dislike of the girl
            turned to hate. He hated her because she was young and pretty.
        </p>

        <p>
            Suddenly he noticed someone else, sitting near the girl,
            wearing the black overalls of an Inner Party member. O'Brien
            was a large man with a thick neck and glasses. Although he
            looked frightening, Winston was interested in him. There was
            sometimes an intelligence in his face that suggested - perhaps -
            that he might question the official Party beliefs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Winston had seen O'Brien about twelve times in almost as
            many years. Years ago he had dreamed about O'Brien. He was in
            a dark room and O'Brien had said to him, We shall meet in the
            place where there is no dark. 'Winston did not know what that
            meant, but he was sure it would happen, one day.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Hate increased. The screaming increased. The voice and
            face of Goldstein became the voice and face of a real sheep. Then
            the sheep-face became a Eurasian soldier, walking towards them
            with his gun, so close that some people shut their eyes for a
            second and moved back in their seats. But at the same moment
            the soldier became the face of Big Brother, black-haired,
            moustached, filling the telescreen. Nobody could hear what Big
            Brother said, but it was enough that he was speaking to them.
            Then the face of Big Brother disappeared from the telescreen and
            the Party slogans came up instead:
        </p>

        <h4>WAR IS PEACE</h4>
        <h4>FREEDOM IS SLAVERY</h4>
        <h4>IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</h4>

        <p>
            Then everybody started shouting 'B-B! B-B!' again and again,
            slowly, with a long pause between the first B and the second. Of
            course Winston shouted too - you had to. But there was a second
        </p>
		</div>|





        <div class="book-page">
		<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
            when the look on his face showed what he was thinking. And at
            that exact moment his eyes met O'Brien's.
        </p>

        <p>O'Brien was pushing his glasses up his nose. But Winston
knew - yes he knew - that O'Brien was thinking the same thing
as he was. 'I am w i th you,' O'Brien seemed to say to him. 'I hate
all this too.' And then the moment of intelligence was gone and
O'Brien's face looked like everybody else's.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center">&bull;</p>

        <p>Winston wrote the date in his diary: April 4th 1984. Then he
stopped. He did not know definitely that this was 1984. He was
thirty-nine, he believed - he had been born in 1944 or 1945. But
nobody could be sure of dates, not really.</p>

        <p>'Who am I writing this diary for?' he asked himself suddenly.
For the future, for the unborn. But if the future was like the
present, it would not listen to him. And if it was different, his
situation would be meaningless.</p>

        <p>The telescreen was playing marching music. What had he
intended to say? Winston stared at the page, then began to write:
Freedom is the freedom to say that two and two make four. If you have
that, everything else follows . . . He stopped. Should he go on? If he
wrote more or did not write more, the result would be the same.
The Thought Police would get him. Even before he wrote
anything, his crime was clear. Thoughtcrime, they called it.</p>

        <p>It was always at night - the rough hand on your shoulder, the
lights in your face. People just disappeared, always during the
night. And then your name disappeared, your existence was
denied and then forgotten. You were, in Newspeak, vaporized.</p>

        <p>Suddenly he wanted to scream. He started writing, fast:</p>
        <h5><i>DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER</i></h5>
        <h5><i>DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER</i></h5>
        <h5><i>DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER</i></h5>
		</div>
        |





		<div class="book-page">
		<p>
            There was a knock on the door. Already! He sat as quietly as a
            mouse, hoping that they would go away. But no, there was
            another knock. He could not delay - that would be the worst
            thing he could do. His heart was racing but even now his face,
            from habit, probably showed nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            He got up and walked heavily towards the door.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Chapter 2. The Spies.</h3>
        <p>
            As he opened the door, Winston saw that he had left the diary
            open on the table. DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER was written
            in it, in letters you could almost read across the room.
        </p>
        <p>
            But everything was all right. A small, sad-looking woman was
            standing outside.
        </p>
        <p>
            'Oh, Comrade Smith,' she said, in a dull little voice, 'do you
            think you could come across and help me with our kitchen sink?
            The water isn't running away and ...'
        </p>
        <p>
            It was Mrs Parsons, his neighbour. She was about thirty but
            looked much older. Winston followed her into her flat. These
            repairs happened almost daily. The Victory Mansions flats were
            old, built in about 1930, and they were falling to pieces. Unless
            you did the repairs yourself, the Party had to agree to them. It
            could take two years to get new glass in a window.
            'Tom isn't home,' Mrs Parsons explained.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Parsons' flat was bigger than Winston's and unattractive in
            a different way. Everything was broken. There were sports clothes
            and sports equipment all over the floor, and dirty dishes on the
            table. On the walls were the red flags of the Young People's
            League and the Spies and a full-sized poster of Big Brother. There
            was the usual smell of old food, but also the smell of old sweat. In
            another room someone was singing with the marching music
            that was still coming from the telescreen.
        </p>
		</div>|









		<div class="book-page">
        <p>
            'It's the children,' said Mrs Parsons, looking in fear at the door to
            the other room. 'They haven't been out today and of course . . .'
            She often stopped without finishing her sentences.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the kitchen, the sink was full of dirty green water.
            ' O f course if Tom was home ...' Mrs Parsons started.
            Tom Parsons worked w i t h Winston at the Ministry of Truth.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was a fat but active man who was unbelievably stupid and
            endlessly enthusiastic. He was a follower with no mind of his
            own - the type that the Party needed even more than they
            needed the Thought Police.
        </p>
        <p>
            At thirty-five Tom Parsons had only just been thrown out of
            the Young People's League, although he had wanted to stay.
            Before that he had continued in the Spies for a year beyond the
            official age. At the Ministry he had a job which needed no
            intelligence, but he worked for the Party every evening,
            organizing walks and other activities. The smell of his sweat filled
            every room he was in and stayed there after he had gone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Winston repaired the sink, taking out the unpleasant knot of
            hair that was stopping the water running away. He washed his
            hands and went back to the other room. 'Put your hands up!' shouted a voice.
        </p>
        <p>
            A big, handsome boy of nine was pointing a toy gun at him.
            His small sister, about two years younger, pointed a piece of
            wood. Both were dressed in the blue, grey and red uniforms of
            the Spies. Winston put his hands up. The look of hate on the
            boy's face made him feel that it was not quite a game.
        </p>
        <p>
            'You're a Eurasian spy!' screamed the boy. 'You're a
            thoughtcriminal! I'll shoot you, I'll vaporize you!'
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly they were both running round him, shouting 'Spy!
            Thoughtcriminal!' The little girl did everything seconds after her
            older brother did it. It was frightening, like the games of young,
            dangerous wild animals that will soon be man-eaters. Winston
            could see that the boy really wanted to hit or kick him, and was
        </p>

            nearly big enough to do so. He was glad that the gun in the boy's
            hand was only a toy.
        </p>
        <p>
            'They wanted to see the Eurasian prisoners hang. But I'm too
            busy to take them and Tom's at...'
        </p>
        <p>
            'We want to see them hang!' shouted the boy, and then the girl
            started shouting it too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes against
            Oceania, were going to hang slowly in the park that evening.
            This happened every month or two and was a popular evening's
            entertainment. Children were often taken to see it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Winston said goodbye to Mrs Parsons and walked towards the
            door. He heard a loud noise as a bomb fell. About twenty or
            thirty of them were falling on London each week. Then he felt a
            terrible pain in the back of his neck. He turned and saw Mrs
            Parsons trying to take some sharp stones from her son's hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            'Goldstein!' screamed the boy.
        </p>
        <p>
            But Winston was most shocked by the look of helpless terror
            on Mrs Parsons' grey face.

        <h3>
            Chapter 3 The Ministry of Truth
        </h3>
        <p>
            Winston pulled the speakwrite towards h im and put on his glasses.
            To the right of the speakwrite there was a small hole, to the left a
            larger one. In the office wall there was a third hole, larger than
            the other two.
        </p>
        <p>
            Messages came to Winston's office through the smallest hole.
            Newspapers came to him through the middle hole. The largest
            hole was for waste paper; hot air carried that away. These large
            holes were called 'memory holes', for some reason.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today four messages had come through the smallest hole,
            onto his desk. The messages were about changes to the Times
            newspaper. For example, in Big Brother's speech in the Times of
        </p>

                17 March, he had said that South India was safe. The Eurasians
                would attack North Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
                This had not happened. The Eurasians had attacked South
                India, not North Africa. Winston had to re-write part of Big
                Brother's speech so you could read in the <i>Times</i> for 17 March
                that Big Brother had known about the attack before it happened.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Winston had finished, his changes to the <i>Times</i> went
                with the newspaper down the middle hole. A new edition would
                soon appear, with his changes. Every copy of the old edition
                would disappear. Destroyed. The message to Winston with the
                changes would disappear down the memory hole, to be burned.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every day newspapers, magazines, photographs, films, posters
                and books were all changed. The past was changed. The Party was
                always right. The Party had always been right. The Records
                Department, where they destroyed all the old copies of
                everything, was the largest department in the Ministry of Truth,
                but there was no truth. The new copies were not true and the old
                copies had not been true either.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the Ministry of Plenty had said they would make
                145 million pairs of boots last year. Sixty-two million pairs were
                made. Winston changed 145 million to 57 million. So the Party
                had made five million more boots last year than they expected to.
                But it was possible that no boots at all were made last year. And it
                was possible that nobody knew or cared how many boots were
                made. You could read in the newspapers that five million extra
                pairs of boots had been made and you could see that half the
                people in Oceania had no boots.
            </p>
            <p>
                Winston looked around the office. A woman with fair hair
                spent all day looking for the names of people who had been
                <i>vaporized</i>. Each of them was, in Newspeak, an <i>unperson</i>. She took
                their names out of every newspaper, book, letter... Her own
                husband had been <i>vaporized</i> last year. She took his name out too.
            </p>
        </div>

            <p>
                People disappeared from the newspapers when they were
                vaporized and they could also appear in the newspapers when
                they did not exist
            </p>
            <p>
                Winston remembered Mr Ogilvy. He had appeared in the
                newspapers because he had led the sort of life the Party wanted.
                Ogilvy had joined the Spies at the age of six. At eleven he told
                the Thought Police that his uncle was a criminal. At seventeen he
                had been an organizer in the Young People's League. At nineteen
                he had invented a new bomb which had killed thirty-one
                Eurasians when it was first tried. At twenty-three, Ogilvy had
                died like a hero, fighting the Eurasians. There were photographs
                of Ogilvy, but there had been no Ogilvy. Not really. The
                photographs were made at the Ministry of Truth. Ogilvy was
                part of a past that never happened.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anything could be changed. A dreamy man with hairy ears
                called Ampleforth re-wrote old poems until they supported
                everything the Party believed in.
            </p>
            <p>
                But all this work, all these changes, were not the main work of
                the Ministry of Truth. Most workers in the Ministry were busy
                writing everything that the people of Oceania read or saw: all the
                newspapers, films, plays, poems, school books, <i>telescreen</i> programmes
                and songs, the Newspeak dictionaries and children's spelling books.
            </p>
            <p>
                After his morning's work, Winston went to the canteen. It was
                full, very noisy and smelled of cheap food and the gin that was
                sold from a hole in the wall.
            </p>
            <p>
                'Ah, I was looking for you' said a voice behind Winston.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was Syme, his friend from the Dictionary Department.
                Perhaps 'friend' was not exactly the right word. You did not have
                friends these days, you had comrades. But some comrades were
                more interesting than others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Syme was working on the eleventh edition of the Newspeak
                Dictionary. He was a small man, even smaller than Winston,
                with dark hair and large eyes. These eyes were sad but they

                seemed to laugh at you and to search your face closely when he
                talked to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                'Have you got any razor blades?' asked Syme.
            </p>
            <p>
                'None,' said Winston quickly, perhaps too quickly. 'I've looked
                for them everywhere.' Everyone was asking for razor blades.
                There had been none in the Party shops for months. There was
                always something which the Party could not make enough of.
                Sometimes it was buttons, sometimes it was wool; now it was
                razor blades. 'I've been using the same blade for six weeks,' he
                lied. He actually had two new ones at home.
            </p>
            <p>
                The people waiting for food and gin moved forward, slowly.
                Winston and Syme took dirty plates from the pile.
            </p>
            <p>
                'Did you go to the park yesterday?' asked Syme. 'All the
                Eurasian prisoners were hanged.'              
            </p>
            <p>
                'I was working,' said Winston. 'I'll see it at the cinema.'
            </p>
            <p>
                'That's not as good,' said Syme. His eyes looked hard at
                Winston's face. 'I know you,' they seemed to say. 'I know why you
                didn't go to see the prisoners die.'
            </p>
            <p>
                Syme was an enthusiastic supporter of the Party's decisions
                about war, prisoners, thoughtcrime, the deaths in the underground
                rooms below the Ministry of Love. Winston always tried to move
                conversation with him away from all that. Syme knew a lot about
                Newspeak and when he talked about language he was interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
                'The prisoners kicked when they were hanged,' said Syme. 'I
                always like that. It spoils it when their legs are tied together. And
                one of them had his tongue hanging right out of his mouth. It
                was quite a bright blue. I like that kind of detail.'
            </p>
            <p>
                'Next, please,' called the prole who was giving out the food,
                and Winston and Syme gave her their plates. She put some grey
                meat on each one. There was also some bread, a small piece of
                cheese and a cup of sugarless black coffee.
            </p>
            <p>
                'There's a table there, under that telescreen,' said Syme. 'Let's get
                a gin and sit there.'
            </p>
        </div>

		<div class="book-page">
            <p>
                The gin was poured for them into big cups and they walked
                through the crowded canteen to a metal table. There were some
                pieces of meat on the table from the last person's meal.
            </p>
            <p>
                They ate in silence. Winston drank down his gin, which
                brought tears to his eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                'How's the Dictionary?' he said, speaking loudly because of
                the noise.
            </p>
            <p>
                ' I'm on the adjectives,' said Syme. 'It's wonderful work. 'His
                eyes shone. He pushed his plate away, took his bread in one pale
                hand and his cheese in the other, and put his mouth near
                Winston's ear so he did not have to shout. 'The eleventh edition
                is the final one,' he said. 'We're building a new language. When
                we've finished, people like you will have to learn to speak again.
                You think the main job is inventing new words, don't you?
                Wrong! We're destroying words — lots of them, hundreds of
                them, every day. We're only leaving the really necessary ones, and
                they'll stay in use for a long time.'
            </p>
            <p>
                He ate his bread hungrily. His thin, dark face had come alive
                and his eyes were shining like the eyes of a man in love. 'It's a
                beautiful thing to destroy words,' he said. 'For example, a word
                like "good". If you have "good" in the language, you don't need
                "bad".You can say "ungood".'
            </p>
            <p>
                Winston smiled. It was safer not to say anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                Syme continued. 'Do you understand? The aim of Newspeak
                is to narrow thought. In the end we will make <i>thoughtcrime</i>
                impossible, because people won't have the words to think the
                crime. By the year 2050 there will be nobody alive who could
                even understand this conversation.'
            </p>
            <p>
                'Except . . .' Winston began and then stopped. He wanted to
                say, 'Except the <i>proles'</i> But he was not sure if the Party would
                accept the thought.
            </p>
            <p>
                Syme had guessed what he was going to say. 'The <i>proles</i> are not
                really people,' he said. 'By 2050 - earlier, probably - you won't

                need a slogan like "freedom is slavery". The word "freedom"
                won't exist, so the whole idea of freedom won't exist either.
                The good Party member won't have ideas. If you're a good Party
                member, you won't need to think.'
            </p>
            <p>
                One of these days, thought Winston, Syme will be vaporized.
                He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too openly.
                He goes to the Chestnut Tree Cafe, where the painters and
                musicians go and where Goldstein himself used to go. The Party
                does not like people like that. One day he will disappear. It is
                written in his face.
            </p>
            <p>
                Syme looked up. 'Here comes Parsons,' he said. You could hear
                his opinion of Parsons in his voice. He thought Parsons was a fool.
            </p>
            <p>
                Winston's neighbour from Victory Mansions was coming
                towards them. He was a fat, middle-sized man with fair hair and
                an ugly face. He looked like a little boy in a man's clothes.
                Winston imagined h im wearing not his blue Party overalls but
                the uniform of the Spies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Parsons shouted 'Hello, hello' happily and sat down at the
                table. He smelled of sweat. Syme took a piece of paper from his
                pocket with a list of words on it and studied the words with an
                ink-pencil between his fingers.
            </p>
            <p>
                'Look at him, working in the lunch hour!' said Parsons. 'What
                have you got there, old boy? Something a bit too clever for me, I
                expect. Smith, old boy, I'll tell you why I 'm chasing you. It's the
                money you forgot to give me.'
            </p>
            <p>
                'What money?' said Winston, feeling for money in his pocket.
                About a quarter of your earnings were paid back to the Party in
                different ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                'The money for Hate Week. You know I collect the money for
                Victory Mansions, and we're going to have the best flags around.
                Two dollars you promised me.'
            </p>
            <p>
                Winston found two dirty dollar notes and gave them to
                Parsons. Parsons wrote 'Two dollars' very carefully in small clear.

                letters next to Winston's name in a little notebook. It was clear
                that he rarely read or wrote.
            </p>
            <p>
                'Oh, Smith, old boy,' he said. 'I hear that son of mine threw
                stones at you yesterday. I talked to him about it. He won't do it
                again, believe me.'
            </p>
            <p>
                'I think he was angry because he couldn't see the Eurasian
                prisoners hang,' said Winston.
            </p>
            <p>
                'Yes! Well, that shows what good children they are, doesn't it?
                Both of them. They only think about the Spies — and the war, of
                course. Do you know what my girl did last week? She was on a
                walk in the country with the Spies and she saw a strange man.
                She and two other girls followed him and then told the police
                about him.'
            </p>
            <p>
                'What did they do that for?'Winston asked, shocked.
            </p>
            <p>
                'They thought he was a Eurasian spy,' said Parsons. 'They
                noticed his shoes were different,' he added proudly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Winston looked at the dirty canteen, looked at all the ugly
                people in their ugly overalls, ate the terrible food and listened to
                the telescreen. A voice from the Ministry of Plenty was saying that
                they were all going to get more chocolate — twenty grammes a
                week. Was he the only one who remembered that last week they
                got thirty grammes? They were getting less chocolate, not more.
                But Parsons would not remember. And even a clever man like
                Syme found a way to believe it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Winston came out of his sad dream. The girl with dark hair, who
                he remembered from the Two Minutes Hate, was at the next table.
                She was looking at him, but when he looked back at her she looked
                away again. Winston was suddenly afraid. Why was she watching
                him? Was she following him? Perhaps she was not in the Thought
                Police, but Party members could be even more dangerous as spies.
                How had he looked when the <i>telescreen</i> voice told them about the
                chocolate? It was dangerous to look disbelieving. There was even a
                word for it in Newspeak: <i>facecrime</i>, it was called.

                Winston ate the terrible food and listened to the telescreen.

                The girl had turned her back to him again. At that moment
                the telescreen told them all to return to work and the three men
                jumped to their feet.

                Winston sat at the table and opened his diary. He thought of his
                parents. He was, he thought, about ten or eleven years old when
                his mother disappeared. She was a tall, silent woman with lovely
                fair hair. He could not remember his father so well. He was dark
                and thin and always wore dark clothes. They had both been
                vaporized in the 1950s. His thoughts moved to other women and
                he started writing in the diary:

                    It was three years ago. It was on a dark evening, in a narrow sidestreet
                    near one of the big railway stations. She had a young face with
                    thick make-up. I liked the make-up. The whiteness and the bright red
                    lips. No woman in the Party wore make-up. There was nobody else in the
                    street and no telescreens. She said two dollars. I...

                It was too difficult to continue. Winston wanted to hit his head
                against the wall, to kick the table over and throw the diary through
                the window - anything to stop the memory of that night.

                It was, of course, illegal to pay a woman for sex. But the
                punishment was about five years in a work camp, not death. The
                Party knew it happened. Some prole women sold themselves for a
                bottle of gin and the Party didn't worry much about that. The Party
                wanted to stop love and pleasure in sex, not sex itself. A request to
                marry would be refused if a man and a woman found each other
                attractive. Sex, to the Party, was only necessary to make children.

                He thought of Katherine, his wife. Winston had been married.
                He was probably still married; if his wife was dead, nobody had
                told him. They had lived together for about fifteen months, nine,
                ten, eleven years ago. Katherine was a tall, fair-haired girl who
